## Important Packages

This app uses the latest version of React, Typescript, React-router-dom, React-Query. Chakra UI was used to manage components and handle CSS.

The project is structed with production in mind, so many of the abstractions here might seem unneccessary but if the app were to scale would prove instrumental in that scenerio
